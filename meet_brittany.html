        <p>Oh, hello! I'm Brittany (but my friends call me Dibbs). Though a born and raised Jersey Girl, I've been based in the Washington, DC area for the past few years. Now, I'm enjoying living in Arlington, VA with my pilot hubby Tim, walking to DCA to watch the planes land, cooking up a storm, and taking weekend trips to nearby historic towns. Personally, I adore dogs, am obsessed with weddings, and am slightly obsessed with Shark Tank.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Having spent the last few years working as a non-profit arts manager and educator, I took the plunge into web design and development in the winter of 2015 through the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. Though I continue to dearly love the arts, I sought a career that would allow me to be creative, and yet relevant; secure, and yet flexible. With a background in the arts and marketing, combined with my skills as a front-end developer, I create applications that are both pretty and practical.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I spend my days listening to relaxing yoga music, lighting copious amounts of vanilla candles, and sipping Starbucks berry refreshers. Though I'm incredibly bubbly and welcoming, I'm a thorough and dedicated worker. My varied professional background has led me on a journey to here, and I wouldn't change a thing!</p>
